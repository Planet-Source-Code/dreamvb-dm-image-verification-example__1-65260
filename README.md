### Description

hi Make this about 30 minutes ago, I was building a Chat Messager program and on the sign up from I wanted some sort of Verification Like you see in most webpages, so I came up with this idea, anyway the most of the code is in a class file and easy to use, You can Generate Random Uppercase, Lower case letters , Digits and also Define your own random words, and More anyway Hope you like it. Please vote if you find it usfull.
